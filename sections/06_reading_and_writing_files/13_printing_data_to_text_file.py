        # 'file=' argument of 'print' tells Python to print where it should print the data to. The default is to print
        # to the screen. But you can print to any output stream that can accept text â€“ including to an 'open file'.

        #  Anything that we can print to the console can also be sent to a file, instead.

# Now let's read the data back:
# After opening the file for reading, we iterate over it, and add each string to the new_list list:
new_list = []
with open(plants_filename, "r") as plants:
    for plant in plants:

# Printing data to a file is quite easy as it's shown on the above using 'print'. But this isn't the only way.
