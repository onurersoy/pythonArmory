    # The CSV writer has a writerows method that will iterate over the items we pass to it, and create a formatted
    # CSV row for each one. As we're passing a list of lists, each inner list will be used to create a row in the
    # CSV file. There's also a writerow method, if you prefer to iterate over the list yourself. That can be
    # useful if you're already generating the data inside a loop. Let's use 'writerow' above for the column headers^^

# You might have to handle missing data in some way â€“ generally, you'd convert it to an empty string before
# writing. The CSV module also has two classes that we can use, for parsing CSV data into a dictionary.
# We will check them on the next section.
