# Level of indentation

# if and else to test conditions > conditions are either True or False
# elif to check several conditions

# Loops:
    # for loop
    # while loop : It's used to loop as long as a condition is True. When you don't know, in advance, how many times
    # the loop should execute.

# Continue and Break: to interrupt the normal flow of a 'for' loop (within if statements etc.)
# else : to define a block that always executes if the loop (for or while) finishes without break

# Augmented assignments
