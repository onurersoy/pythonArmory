# We're going to be looking at some slightly more advanced Python features. Now we're going to start with generators
# which, as you see, are a great way to work with huge amounts of data.

# Now, another very useful feature in Python is comprehensions. We're going to be having a look at what they have,
# and ways in which they can lead us to things that would ordinarily be challenging using a standard iterator.

# And the third thing we're going to be looking at in this section is lambdas, what they are and why Python still has
# them and alternatives to using them.
