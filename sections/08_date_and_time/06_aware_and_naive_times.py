# A time is 'aware' if it contains timezone information.
# Conversely, a time is described as 'naive' if it doesn't have any timezone associated with it.

# Naive times are useful for f.e. applications such as timing how long something takes. You take the difference between
# the start and end times, and aren't interested in which timezone the event happened.
