So about '23_html_doc_(composition).py', our HtmlDot class is now displaying polymorphic behaviour, it is a
html doc, but it can also be used in place of a body object, it can even be used in place of any of our tag, it just
needs to display method.

So we've implemented polymorphism without using inheritance but using composition. We said that using inheritance isn't
the only way to achieve polymorphism.

The program itself on '23_html_doc_(composition).py' does use inheritance; all our other classes inherit from tag. But
the HtmlDoc isn't a subclass of tag; it provides the same methods as tag but does so by defining methods with the same
name and then delegating the implementation of those methods to the classes that is composed of.
