        # However, this isn't an ideal solution. Performing that test, on line 8, takes time â€“ testing conditions is
        # a relatively slow operation. Our trial could include thousands, or tens of thousands, of patients. It's wise
        # to use 'Exception' here, but we did not cover it yet. We'll be covering it soon tho.
        prescription.remove(warfarin)
    # prescription.discard(warfarin)
    # We could have use 'discard' too, but if a patient normally isn't using Warfarin, it wouldn't give us any error
    # but would add 'Edoxaban' to his/her prescription. What we wanted to achieve was replacing them, not adding
    # Edoxaban to someone that not using Warfarin. That's why 'remove' is the best option here because it would give
    # us an error if the patient doesn't have Warfarin on the prescription.

    # A crash is definitely better than killing Kenny. You may be thinking "hy don't we just check if warfarin is
    # in the set, before we try to remove it?" We could definitely do that. Let's do it^^ (Line 8)
