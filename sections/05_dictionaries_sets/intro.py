# INTRODUCTION:

# Lists and tuples are sequence types. That means we can use indexing to access individual items.
# Dictionaries and sets aren't sequences. We can't access the items using index positions.

# ================================================================================================================

# When dealing with items in a dictionary, we use a 'key' to get individual values from the dictionary.
# Dictionaries store 'key/value' pairs.

# You'll also find a dictionary referred to as a 'mapping'. If you know Java, then a Python 'dict' is equivalent to
# a Java 'HashMap'.

# ================================================================================================================

# A set is an unordered collection of things. There's no way to retrieve a specific item from a set.
